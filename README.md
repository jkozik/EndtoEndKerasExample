# Tensorflow Keras Examples
Borrowing from the [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials), I world through 5 of them to help me learn Tensorflow.

Things I learned:
- There is a large data base of text and images; they are easily pulled in and stored in my $HOME/.keras directory
- It is obvious, but you have to follow the loss/accuracy metrics.  If your model converges, great.  But what do you do if it doesn't?  Tensorflow has lots of tools to help.
- The layers of the model including things to help with overfitting. For example, tools to flip/rotate images to increase the sampling size
- MNIST datasets are cool. Examples include:  handwritten digits, fashion images.  TF also links to Kaggle and IMDB
